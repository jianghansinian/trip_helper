<div class="article-content">
<p>"Red flowers and green leaves" is a common aesthetic image.  <br/>"The red flower still needs the green leaves to support it" is a widely circulated aesthetic principle.  <br/>In ancient poetry, whether it is the contrast of "new green layers among the branches, small buds hiding deep with specks of red" or the juxtaposition of "endless lotus leaves stretching to the sky, lotus flowers glowing uniquely red under the sun," this aesthetic concept is constantly emphasized.  <br/>Red flowers are like a famous singer in full attire at the center of the stage. Green leaves are like the accompanying dancers swaying gracefully around the singer.  <br/>Has it always been this way?  <br/>Perhaps not. Flowers are not necessarily red, and leaves are not necessarily green. Moreover, different varieties of plants, or even the same variety in different seasons, can vary.  <br/>Is it beautiful just because it has always been this way?  <br/>Perhaps not. I remember many years ago, at the Beijing Nationalities Cultural Palace Grand Theatre, watching Yang Liping's dance performance at her peak. It was not dance accompanying song, but song accompanying dance. The music and stage design have faded from memory, but her stunning peacock dance remains vivid and unforgettable. Of course, this can also be interpreted as the dancer being the flower and others being the leaves.  <br/>Plants and trees take turns to shine throughout the seasons.  <br/>This is the changing palette observed over years of living in Beijing. At the moment, in late autumn and early winter, it is not the flowers but the leaves that shine.  <br/>On a weekend afternoon, I went for a walk in Dongfeng Park. The ground was covered with large sycamore leaves, some green with yellow, some yellow tinged with red, and some red with a translucent glow. A single giant five-pointed leaf could cover a person's entire face. The endless fallen leaves made me hesitate to move forward, reluctant to disturb them. My wife crouched on the ground, carefully selecting leaves, surrounded by a kaleidoscope of colors as if she were in a painting. When she stood up, she held two large handfuls of colorful sycamore leaves, happy as a child, sometimes crossing her arms to pose, sometimes raising the leaves toward the setting sun, and finally tossing a big handful into the sky...  <br/>At this time of year, if there are leaves more beautiful than sycamore, they are ginkgo leaves. Indeed, unlike the desolation of willow leaves, the droopiness of peach leaves, the stiffness of poplar leaves, or even the mottled appearance of sycamore leaves, the dazzling ginkgo leaves are simply radiant. Hanging on the trees, they shimmer like gold; fallen on the ground, they form a golden carpet. A poet described falling ginkgo leaves as "golden butterflies dancing gracefully" and "suddenly startling the world with their success." The natural spectacle they present is truly breathtaking and awe-inspiring.  <br/>Many years ago, a girl from the south came to Beijing for the first time and was deeply moved by the golden ginkgo leaves of autumn. She placed a carefully crafted golden "leaf crown" on her braided hair, resembling a Greek goddess wearing an olive wreath. She collected many leaves, painted many bookmarks, and gave them to many friends. To this day, I still keep that small yellow fan-shaped leaf with a panda leaning against a rock. Ginkgo leaves became her lasting memory of the capital's scenery.  <br/>However, after a few winds blow, the countdown begins again. Ginkgo leaves fade, and the smoke trees turn red.  <br/>Xiangshan, located in the west of Beijing, is named for its rocks that resemble incense burners. When I first arrived in Beijing, viewing the red leaves of Xiangshan was a cherished annual aspiration. Despite being 20 kilometers away, Xiangshan remained the destination for our years of cycling and climbing.  <br/>After the first frost each year, as temperatures drop and the temperature difference increases, the more than 100,000 smoke trees covering Xiangshan begin to change color, displaying shades of green, yellow, orange, and red. At their peak, they settle into a deep red, creating a magnificent landscape ranging from fiery red to deep purple-red.  <br/>An old writer once lamented: "These red leaves are like life itself. After experiencing the growth of spring and the prosperity of summer, they reveal their most brilliant colors in autumn."  <br/>During a visit to the National Art Museum of China, one collection piece stood out. The painting was a vast expanse of red, with majestic mountains dominating the center. In the foreground, red trees stood as silhouettes, framing white waterfalls, streams, and tiled houses, creating an immersive and almost audible experience. The painting directly captures the imagery of Mao Zedong's poem: "Mountains are all red, forests are dyed layer by layer," evoking a grand and majestic landscape that reflects a longing for life and a celebration of existence, embodying infinite spirit and upward vitality in its tranquility.  <br/>This is a famous work by the painter Li Keran from the 1960s. Although it explicitly depicts the landscapes of Sichuan and Guangdong, my first impression was that it was related to the red leaves of Xiangshan.  <br/>As expected.  <br/>Later, I learned that Li Keran created seven versions of "Mountains Are All Red, Forests Are Dyed Layer by Layer." The first two were painted in Conghua, Guangdong, in 1962 and 1963, while the remaining five were created consecutively in 1964 at the Badachu studio near Xiangshan in Beijing.  <br/>Red leaves like fire, mountains ablaze. Li Keran, the renowned artist who advocated "entering with the greatest effort and emerging with the greatest courage," finally carved out a new artistic realm of vibrant red.  <br/>Looking out the window, clouds drift and gather. Seasons alternate, flowers bloom, and leaves fall. Countless lives rise and fall.  <br/>You support me, I help you.  <br/>Back and forth, in and out.  <br/>You have your brilliance, I have my dignity.  <br/>In the end, perhaps it is not about who complements whom, but about shining on one's own. This may be the most important thing.</p>
