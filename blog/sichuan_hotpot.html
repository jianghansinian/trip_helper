                </div>

                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>Let me start by saying this: I have regrets. Not many, but definitely some. When I walked into a random hole-in-the-wall hot pot restaurant in Chengdu with my new hostel friends, I was feeling confident. "I can handle spicy food," I declared. "I eat Thai food all the time back home."</p>

                    <p>Oh, sweet summer child. I knew nothing.</p>

                    <h2>The Challenge Begins</h2>

                    <p>The challenge started innocently enough. My Australian friend Jake bet me ¥200 ($30) that I couldn't try every single item on the menu. The catch? I had to eat at least three pieces of each ingredient. I looked at the menu – or rather, the picture menu with no English – and counted maybe 40 different items. How hard could it be?</p>

                    <p>The waiter brought out our hot pot, split down the middle: one side clear broth (the "non-spicy" side that was still quite spicy), the other side a bubbling red oil concoction that looked like molten lava. The Sichuan peppercorns floating on top should have been my first warning.</p>

                    <div class="warning-box">
                        <strong>⚠️ Spice Warning:</strong> Sichuan hot pot uses both chili peppers (for heat) and Sichuan peppercorns (for that numbing, tingling sensation called "málà"). Together, they create an experience that's less "spicy" and more "your mouth is having an out-of-body experience."
                    </div>

                    <h2>Round 1: The Familiar Stuff (Spice Level: Manageable)</h2>

                    <p>I started with the easy wins – things I recognized and could mentally prepare for:</p>

                    <div class="food-rating">
                        <div class="rating-item">
                            <strong>Beef Slices (肥牛)</strong>
                            <div><span class="stars">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</span> <span style="color: #4caf50;">Amazing</span></div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="rating-item">
                            <strong>Lamb (羊肉)</strong>
                            <div><span class="stars">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</span> <span style="color: #4caf50;">Perfect</span></div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="rating-item">
                            <strong>Mushrooms (香菇)</strong>
                            <div><span class="stars">⭐⭐⭐⭐</span> <span style="color: #4caf50;">Great</span></div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="rating-item">
                            <strong>Tofu (豆腐)</strong>
                            <div><span class="stars">⭐⭐⭐⭐</span> <span style="color: #4caf50;">Solid</span></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>So far, so good. The meat was incredible, perfectly cooked in the spicy broth. The numbing sensation from the Sichuan peppercorns was weird but not unpleasant. I was feeling cocky. Jake was looking worried that he might lose his bet.</p>

                    <p>"Bring on the weird stuff!" I announced to our table.</p>

                    <h2>Round 2: Things That Made Me Think Twice (Spice Level: Intense)</h2>

                    <p>This is where things got interesting. The waiter brought out a tray of items that looked... suspicious.</p>

                    <h3>Duck Intestines (鸭肠)</h3>
                    <p>Long, tube-like things that looked exactly like what they were. I watched a Chinese couple at the next table expertly swish them through the hot pot for exactly 8 seconds, so I did the same. The texture was crunchy – like al dente pasta but... meatier? Not as bad as I expected. <span class="stars">⭐⭐⭐</span></p>

                    <h3>Pig Blood Cake (猪血)</h3>
                    <p>Cubes of dark, jelly-like substance. Tasted mineral-y and absorbed the hot pot flavor well. Once I got past the concept of what I was eating, it was actually pretty good. <span class="stars">⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>

                    <h3>Tripe (毛肚)</h3>
                    <p>The honeycomb texture was wild. Chewy, crunchy, and so full of flavor from the spicy oil. This became one of my favorites! <span class="stars">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>

                    <h3>Quail Eggs (鹌鹑蛋)</h3>
                    <p>Tiny eggs that looked adorable floating in the pot. Hard-boiled and delicious. These were my palate cleanser between the more adventurous items. <span class="stars">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>

                    <div class="spice-meter">
                        <div class="spice-indicator" style="left: 60%;"></div>
                    </div>
                    <p style="text-align: center; color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Current Spice Level: Mouth is definitely on fire</p>

                    <h2>Round 3: The Point of No Return (Spice Level: What Have I Done)</h2>

                    <p>I was about halfway through the menu when I started to realize I might have bitten off more than I could chew – literally. The problem with hot pot is that it gets spicier as you go. The oil builds up. The numbing intensifies. My lips had lost all feeling.</p>

                    <h3>Pig Brain (猪脑)</h3>
                    <p>This is where I almost tapped out. It arrived looking like... well, a brain. Lumpy, grayish-white, and terrifying. I closed my eyes, thought of the ¥200, and went for it.</p>

                    <blockquote>"It tastes like extremely soft scrambled eggs mixed with cream cheese, but with the texture of tofu that's been left out too long. I can't say I enjoyed it, but I also can't say it was terrible. It was just... brain." - My notes from that night</blockquote>

                    <p><span class="stars">⭐⭐</span> Would not recommend unless you're doing a challenge like me.</p>

                    <h3>Frog (田鸡)</h3>
                    <p>Honestly? Tasted like chicken but with more bones. The bones were annoying, but the meat was tender and delicious. <span class="stars">⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>

                    <h3>Century Egg (皮蛋)</h3>
                    <p>I'd had these before, but never in hot pot. The ammonia smell hit me before I even got it to my mouth. Tasted like a regular hard-boiled egg that had been buried in your backyard for a few months. <span class="stars">⭐⭐</span></p>

                    <h3>Pig Kidney (腰花)</h3>
                    <p>Surprisingly mild tasting, but the texture was like biting into a pencil eraser. <span class="stars">⭐⭐⭐</span></p>

                    <h2>The Final Boss: Special Delicacies</h2>

                    <p>At this point, I was visibly sweating. Not just from the spice, but from the sheer volume of food I'd consumed. My mouth was completely numb. I couldn't feel my lips. The Chinese families around us were openly staring and laughing. I'd become dinner theater.</p>

                    <h3>Goose Intestines (鹅肠)</h3>
                    <p>Similar to duck intestines but longer and thicker. At this point, everything tasted like fire. <span class="stars">⭐⭐⭐</span></p>

                    <h3>Pig Throat (喉管)</h3>
                    <p>Cartilage-y and chewy. Every bite made crunching sounds. My table mates winced watching me eat this. <span class="stars">⭐⭐</span></p>

                    <h3>Beef Omasum (牛百叶)</h3>
                    <p>This is the third stomach of a cow. It looked like a sponge and had the texture of one too. Actually pretty good when you ignore what it is! <span class="stars">⭐⭐⭐⭐</span></p>

                    <h2>The Aftermath</h2>

                    <p>I did it. I finished every item on that menu. It took three hours, cost about ¥400 ($60) worth of food, and probably shortened my life by a year. But I won Jake's ¥200 bet!</p>

                    <p>Here's what happened in the 24 hours after:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hour 1:</strong> Felt like a champion. Took victory photos. Immediately regretted the victory photos when I saw how red and sweaty my face was.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hour 2:</strong> Stomach started making concerning noises. Discovered that Sichuan peppercorns create a burning sensation on both entry AND exit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hour 4:</strong> Could not sleep. Partially from excitement, mostly from indigestion. Drank half a liter of milk.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hour 8:</strong> The morning after. Let's just say my digestive system was not pleased with my life choices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hour 24:</strong> Finally felt normal again. Immediately started craving hot pot.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="warning-box">
                        <strong>💊 Survival Tips:</strong>
                        <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                            <li>Have milk or yogurt handy (water makes it worse!)</li>
                            <li>White rice is your friend – it helps absorb the oils</li>
                            <li>Don't plan any important activities the next day</li>
                            <li>Bring tissues – you WILL sweat</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>

                    <p><strong>1. Hot pot is a marathon, not a sprint.</strong> Pace yourself. The locals spend 2-3 hours at hot pot for a reason.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. The "weird" stuff is often delicious.</strong> Tripe became one of my favorite foods in China. I never would have tried it if not for this challenge.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Sichuan people are incredibly friendly.</strong> The staff and other diners were so encouraging (and amused) by my challenge. An elderly couple at the next table even sent over some herbal tea to help with the spice.</p>

                    <p><strong>4. Know your limits.</strong> Okay, I clearly didn't follow this one, but YOU should. There's no shame in not eating pig brain.</p>

                    <p><strong>5. This is peak Chinese food culture.</strong> Hot pot isn't just about eating – it's social, communal, and incredibly fun despite the pain.</p>

                    <h2>Would I Do It Again?</h2>

                    <p>Absolutely. But next time, I'm skipping the brain and the throat. And maybe I'll stick to the non-spicy side of the pot. Maybe.</p>

                    <p>Hot pot has become my favorite Chinese dining experience. There's something magical about sitting around a bubbling pot with friends (or strangers who become friends), cooking your own food, and pushing your taste boundaries. Even if those boundaries involve internal organs and enough chili oil to fuel a small car.</p>

                    <p>If you're in Chengdu, do yourself a favor and try authentic Sichuan hot pot. Just maybe don't try to eat EVERYTHING on the menu like an idiot. Learn from my mistakes. Your digestive system will thank you. 🌶️</p>
